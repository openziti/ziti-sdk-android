**14. Indemnification.**

**14.1. By Customer.**  Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless NetFoundry and its officers, directors,
employees, affiliates, and agents from any claims, costs, loss, liabilities, or expenses (including reasonable
attorney&#39;s fees) resulting from, relating to, or arising out of Customer&#39;s or any End User&#39;s (1) acts or
omissions in using the Software; (2) breach of this Agreement; and/or (3) violation of any applicable law, rule,
regulation, or third party right.

**14.2. By NetFoundry**  NetFoundry will defend at its own expense any action against Customer brought by a
third party to the extent that the action is based upon a claim that the Software when used and accessed in accordance
with this Agreement directly infringes such third party&#39;s U.S. copyright or patent rights. NetFoundry will pay
those costs and damages finally awarded against Customer in any such action that are specifically attributable to such
claim or those costs and damages agreed to in a monetary settlement of such action. If the Software becomes, or in

expense, either (a) procure for Customer the right to continue exercising the rights licensed to Customer in this
Agreement; (b) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing and remains functionally equivalent;
or (c) terminate all rights and licenses granted to Customer under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

use of the Software in combination with other products, equipment, software, or data not supplied by NetFoundry if
such infringement would not have arisen but for such combination; (iii) any use of any release of the Software other

third party claims that the Software infringes that third party&#39;s intellectual property rights, NetFoundry, not
Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual
property infringement claim. This Section states NetFoundry&#39;s entire liability and Customer&#39;s sole and
exclusive remedy for infringement claims and action. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on Customer notifying
NetFoundry promptly in writing of such action, giving NetFoundry sole control of the defense thereof and any related
settlement negotiations, and cooperating and, at NetFoundry&#39;s reasonable request and expense, assisting in such
defense. Customer will, at its own expense, defend and indemnify NetFoundry and its affiliates against any damages,
liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees)resulting from and claim arising
from or relating to (1) an IP Exclusion or (2) Customer&#39;s and/or its Users&#39; relationship or use of the
Software, except to the extent the claim is subject to indemnification above by NetFoundry.
